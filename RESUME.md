Summary: I build things that solve problems for people. Preferably for lots of people. Preferably challenging problems.

2013:  
Worked as an accountant out of college in Hawaii for a small E-commerce startup wearing several hats - including getting lunch for my boss. Worked at a scuba diving barge at the same time getting certified for free! Notice there was a web developer at my company, thought he was pretty cool with his hoodie and multiple matrix screens. I had to wear a tie.


2014:  
My company closed down. Moved back to mainland LA, taught myself casino card games and became a dealer for a year. Got a job as dealer easily because I was Asian and an Accountant - gotta love positive discrimination. Did some part-time work in a bar as well.


Late 2014 - 2015:
Left the country with 680$, traveled sometime in Central America, then traveled sometime in southeast Asia. Did many strange jobs and volunteering stuff including working at a Chinese owned city and casino in Laos.


Mid 2015:  
Found myself in Cambodia village near the Mekong. With no technical background, I decided to port the Khan Academy website to a local intranet so the 208 kids can learn STEM for free off of some cheap tablets we sourced from an Indian company. Asked a Swiss guy in a cafe to fund the cash for hardware, asked a network engineer from Guatemala to help with Linux stuff. [Turned out to be pretty awesome and it is alot better now as more people visit and develop the program further:](https://learningequality.org/blog/2014/small-cambodian-village-experiences-ka-lite/)


Late 2015 - 2016:  
Realized what coding is actually for: creating stuff, building versions of the future that don’t even exist yet. Isolated myself in the Northern Thailand Golden Triangle for 4 months learning Javascript, while using the village kids as guinea pigs for my silly Javascript HTML5 games. Did some websites for friends, hostels, and random strangers I meet. Started having crazy grandiose startup ideas at this time as well.


2016:  
Tuned down my crazy startup ideas a little and decided to apply for crazy startups instead. Was able to get some (free)lance work for some early stage startups, SushiVid, LizardApps. Worked on contract for a transportation startup (CatchThatBus) for several contracts building their CMS system, CRM-payments system, inventory, and analytics systems. Viren the CEO is an awesome guy.


Now:  
Finishing up contract with current company. Getting exciting about mobile development using hybrid technologies and maybe... Java. Maybe. Starting to see the big picture and extremely excited how Big Data, micro web services, IOT will develop in the coming years. Spending a lot of my time learning data analysis and mining with R. Shell scripts are probably the single most useful all-purpose tool for developers. 

- Not a typical resume, but my career path isn’t exactly typical and I haven’t use a resume in years.
- It’s much more interesting if I show you guys what I’m building.
